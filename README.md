# Path-Planning-for-Robot-in-a-Maze-using-Breadth-First-Search


A robot is navigated through a maze under dynamic obstacles from a start node to a goal node fed by
the user,(which is usually directed towards the center of the maze as its goal node).


The Micromouse Simulator is implemented for the GUI interpretation of the path in the maze. It is
used for navigating the two types of mobile robots comprising of Wheeled and Tracked attributes.

The program exits when no path can be formed between the current position of the robot to its goal
node or when it reaches the goal node.


We denote the current/start position of the robot with "S" and the goal position is denoted with "G".


The prominent Object oriented programming concepts of Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction and
Encapsulation is implemented by the creating classes to store the data privately, and access the data
in derived classes as per the requirement. Polmorphism implementation is seen in virtual function
methods and also in pointers and reference objects to base class.


The code is generated using Breadth First Search(BFS) as a search algorithm for the robot navigation
to the goal node in the maze.


An API class is created which consists a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of
applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other services.
